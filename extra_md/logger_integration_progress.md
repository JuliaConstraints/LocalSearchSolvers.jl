## Summary

All files have been processed. The implementation now:

1. Uses custom logger macros (@ls_debug, @ls_info, @ls_warn, @ls_error) that leverage Julia's standard logging system
2. Removes all _verbose calls
3. Maintains the existing logger functionality
4. Has minimal performance impact when logging is disabled

The println calls in logger.jl and display.jl were kept as they are part of the logger implementation itself, not classic logging that needs to be replaced.
